# Introduction To Stack By MohitðŸ˜‰

## StackðŸŽ¯:-
- Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out). LIFO implies that the element that is inserted last, comes out first and FILO implies that the element that is inserted first, comes out last.
- We can not see all the data stored or present in Stack.

## Operations In StackðŸ¤”:-
### PUSH():
- Push method are used to insert data in the Stack.

### POP():
- Pop method are used to remove and show the deleted element from stack.

### PEEK():
- Peek method is used for return the top element from stack without deletion.

### SIZE():
- Size method is used for return the total size of the stack or counting of elements present in stack.

### Empty():
- empty method used for check if the Stack is empty or not.

## Advantage of StackðŸš€:-
- Easy implementation: Stack data structure is easy to implement using arrays or linked lists, and its operations are simple to understand and implement.
- Efficient memory utilization: Stack uses a contiguous block of memory, making it more efficient in memory utilization as compared to other data structures.
- Fast access time: Stack data structure provides fast access time for adding and removing elements as the elements are added and removed from the top of the stack.

## Disadvantages of StackðŸ˜¥:-
- Limited capacity: Stack data structure has a limited capacity as it can only hold a fixed number of elements. If the stack becomes full, adding new elements may result in stack overflow, leading to the loss of data.
- No random access: Stack data structure does not allow for random access to its elements, and it only allows for adding and removing elements from the top of the stack. To access an element in the middle of the stack, all the elements above it must be removed.
- Memory management: Stack data structure uses a contiguous block of memory, which can result in memory fragmentation if elements are added and removed frequently.

## ConclusionðŸ˜®:-
- Stack is one of the most effective techniques to instil discipline in a system. Stack is a strong tool for storing and managing data in the desired manner, thanks to a basic data structure. It may be thought of as a route with an entry that allows for both insertion and removal operations.
